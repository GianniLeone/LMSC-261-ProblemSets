# LMSC-261-ProblemSet2
 
### Project Name

Problem Set 3

### Submitted by

Gianni Leone

### For Course

LMSC-261

### Due Date

04:00:00 PM on February 12, 2020	

### Submission Date

01:50:00 PM on 2/5/2020

### Files Included

-   README.md
-   ProblemSet3.4.c
-   ProblemSet3.5.c

### Purpose

The purpose of this problem set was to understand the basics of C programming using the printf function and declaring variables to be printed.

### Description

Both project sets use the printf function to print to the command line, except the ProjectSet3.5 uses pointers within the print f function to make the code more modular. If one wanted to change the numbers being printed they could just change the variable values declared at the beginning on the code instead of digging through the code to change an individual value.


### Build and Run Commands

clang/gcc to compile 

./(filename) to run

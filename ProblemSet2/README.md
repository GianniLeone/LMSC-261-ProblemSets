My project consists of two sprites, a dinosaur and a sloth. My dinosaur uses two threads of code, one to change its size from large to small repetitively, and the other to trigger a loud bite sound when its big and a quiet bite sound when its small.

My other sprite is a sloth and I used randomly changing variables to set the X and Y screen coordinates and volume. I then mapped a chord to its motion and the volume to the spries size and pitch of the chord to the sprites y value.

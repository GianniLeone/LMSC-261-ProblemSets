# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Audio Website in Java

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I plan to create simple audio devices/plugins/games to embed into a website using Javascript.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In my project, my software will be a website that hosts Java scripts. These Java codes will allow the client to upload audio files, and put simple audio effects on them. The main goal should be to demonstrate to a non-musician the power of audio editing and how it can change sound.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A website with pre embedded audio capable of applying one or two audio effects to said audio.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A website that can upload an audio file and apply a few simple audio effects to the audio.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A fully functioning site that is capable of uploading audio files and applying many different audio effects to the audio.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I already have a website draft set up and ready to go. My next steps would be to find out how to allow the user to upload audio files to the website. After that I would need to develop a few simple audio effects in JavaScript. If all goes well, I will work on more complex audio affects and add more pages to the website.

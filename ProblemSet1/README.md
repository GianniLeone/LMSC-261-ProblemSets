The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use GitHub and Markdown.

The Problem Set 1.1 covered how to use the Git version control system with GitHub. I had to learn the basic terminology, such as commit, pull, and push, used in Git/GitHub to understand how to version control software. The Problem Set 1.2 was about writing a read me. We were required to use the syntax such as `#`, `*`, and `--` to format the README.md file so that the file is formatted nicely on GitHub when it is displayed.

Additionally, the pseudocode included has a purpose of mapping out the basic archetecture of a code before it is written. The PhoneBookText file describes a way to randomly find a name within a phone book.

I used the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) on GitHub to figure out the syntax for Markdown. Also I used other online refrences for markdown.
